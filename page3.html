                there is the nurse who tells you she is afraid she is an incorrigible flirt, but somehow she just can't help it. she also pronounces "picturesque" picture-skew, and "unique" un-i-kew, and it is amazing how often she manages to introduce these words into her conversation, leading the laughter herself. also, when she leaves the room, she says "see you anon." you have not shot her yet. maybe monday.
